## ‚û°Ô∏è How to start with CORE:

> If you are in a competition right now, you got lost. Please go to [coregame.de](https://coregame.de/), sign in, join the competition, create your team & clone the repository that is automatically created for you. This is where you can create your bot.

### _To start developing CORE / Run it locally on your own:_

1. Clone the [monorepo](https://github.com/42core-team/monorepo) repo with ssh. (`git clone git@github.com:42core-team/monorepo.git`)
   - The Monorepo contains absolutely everything in one unified development environment.
2. Run `make update` to initialize & pull the newest versions of all the relevant submodules.
3. Open the folder in [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) and open it in the devcontainer with the [devcontainer extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.remote-containers).
4. Open up a seperate terminal & run `make start-visualizers`, keep this terminal open for as long as you want the visualizers to be accessible. Once launches the visualizers will be available under `localhost:8080` (debug) and `localhost:5173` (3d).
5. Run `make run` to get started, use `make debug` if you want to see the other bots & the servers output. Check out the configs to tweak a lot about how everything runs.
6. __We'd love issues or pull requests from anyone!__ üôÉ
