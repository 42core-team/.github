## ‚û°Ô∏è How to start with CORE:

> If you are in a competition right now, you got lost. Please go to [coregame.de](https://coregame.de/), sign in, join the competition, create your team & clone the repository that is automatically created for you. This is where you can create your bot.

### _To start developing core / Run it locally on your own:_

1. Clone the [sandbox](https://github.com/42core-team/sandbox) repo with ssh.
   - The Sandbox simply has all the relevant submodules in one unified development environment.
2. Run make update to initialize & pull the newest versions of all the relevant submodules.
3. Open the folder in [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) and open it in the devcontainer with the [devcontainer extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.remote-containers).
4. Open up a seperate terminal & run `make visualizer`, keep this terminal open for as long as you want the visualizer to be accessible.
5. Run `make debug` to get started.
6. __We'd love issues or pull requests from anyone!__ üôÉ
